# RandoMount
A FFXI Windower addon to select a random mount from those that you own!

Clone this repo, or copy/paste RandoMount.lua inside a folder, also named RandoMount. 
Place this repo or folder inside the addons folder in your Windower4 directory.

In-game, you can type //lua l RandoMount to get it up and running.
You can also append the command lua l RandoMount to the end of init.txt, in the scripts folder.
That'll make it automatically load when you log in.

Once RandoMount is loaded, you can use the command //RandoMount or //rmount to Mount UP!
with a randomly chosen mount you have unlocked. This addon will not use the trainer's whistle.
Use /console rmount to create a macro on your in-game macro palette.

Happy Adventuring!
